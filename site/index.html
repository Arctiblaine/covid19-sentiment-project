            Our project’s goal is to figure out how the people of the United
            States felt during different points in the pandemic and how certain
            decisions that were made by governments whether they be federal or
            local affected those emotions. In studying these emotions we hope
            that we can help outline the effects of certain decisions made, in
            order to be better prepared if something like this would occur again
            in the future. We are working on a project where we do a sentiment
            analysis on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit in order to discern
            responses that the United States felt during different periods of
            the pandemic. The goal in examining three different social media
            platforms is to see if there are any discernible differences in
            sentiment between them.
