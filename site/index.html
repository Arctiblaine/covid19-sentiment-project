          <p>
            Our project’s goal is to figure out how the people of the United
            States felt during different points in the pandemic (lockdowns and
            other rules) and how certain decisions that were made by government
            officials affected those emotions. In studying these emotions we
            hope that we can help outline the effects of certain decisions made,
            in order to be better prepared if something like this would occur
            again in the future. We are working on a project where we do a
            sentiment analysis on different social media sites (Twitter,
            Facebook, and Reddit) in order to discern responses that the United
            States felt during different periods of the pandemic. The goal in
            using 3 different applications is to see if there are any
            discernible difference of sentiment between them. In the end, we
            will build a website in order to host all of our findings.
