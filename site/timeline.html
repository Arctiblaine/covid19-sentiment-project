            March 11, 2020 - WHO declares the novel coronavirus outbreak to be a
            pandemic. WHO says the outbreak is the first pandemic caused by a
            coronavirus. In an Oval Office address, Trump announces that he is
            restricting travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days in
            an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. The ban, which applies
            to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, applies only to foreign
            nationals and not American citizens and permanent residents who'd be
            screened before entering the United States.

            March 19 - California Issues Statewide Stay-at-Home Order:
            California becomes the first state to issue a stay-at-home order,
            mandating all residents to stay at home except to go to an essential
            job or shop for essential needs. The order also instructs health
            care systems to prioritize services to those who are the sickest.

            March 25, 2020 - The White House and Senate leaders reach an
            agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus deal to offset the economic
            damage of coronavirus, producing one of the most expensive and
            far-reaching measures in the history of Congress.

            April 3, 2020 - Trump says his administration is now recommending
            Americans wear "non-medical cloth" face coverings, a reversal of
            previous guidance that suggested masks were unnecessary for people
            who weren't sick.

            April 8 - Troubles With the COVID-19 Cocktail “What do you have to
            lose?” Trump asks when touting the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine
            or the related chloroquine as possible treatments for COVID-19. With
            a common antibiotic, azithromycin, the drug cocktail becomes an
            early candidate to prevent hospitalization or death. But Trump’s
            promotion of the combination, despite known heart risks for some
            patients, prompts the American Heart Association, the American
            College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society to warn in a
            joint guidance that the drugs are not for everyone.

            May 11, 2020 - Trump and his administration announce that the
            federal government is sending $11 billion to states to expand
            coronavirus testing capabilities. The relief package signed on April
            24 includes $25 billion for testing, with $11 billion for states,
            localities, territories, and tribes.

            the US to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as
            soon as late October. In the documents, posted by The New York
            Times, the CDC provides planning scenarios to help states prepare
            and advises on who should get vaccinated first -- healthcare
            professionals, essential workers, national security "populations"
            and long-term care facility residents and staff.
