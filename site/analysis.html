      <h2 class="analysis-header">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="analysis-text"> As explained on the homepage of the website, the purpose of this project was to discern how certain decisions that were made by the United States Government affected the population's emotions. In order to accomplish this task we picked 10 important decisions that the government made and then using the dates that the decision occured, pulled post from the data that we scraped. The data was visualized in order to see if the sentiment mean was negative, neutral, or positive. Then we ran a Kruskal-Wallis Test in order to see if there was any significant difference between the means of the decisions made. Lastly, a Dunn's Test was ran in order do a pairwise comparison to find out specifically which pairs of groups were statistically significant different</p>
