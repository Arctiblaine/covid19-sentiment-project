            <p>Y’all are some fucking losers. Lol if you people had friends you would know that you can exist with other people who have different opinions. Let me blow your mind for a sec. You can actually be FRIENDS with people who don’t share your politics either. Nobody likes to be put down. I don’t usually support the right but I don’t put them down either because I have friends who are. Y’all didn’t even like the message that I responded to. You just disliked mine. Y’all are just mad that you are the worst people. You probably preach togetherness. Haha I hope more of you fuckers downvote my shit for no reason. Every time I see it I am just reminded of a poll i saw earlier that says something like 76% of reddit users can’t do a pushup. Stay mad. You don’t have good friends. Your girlfriends are ugly if ya even got one but worst of all you are a disappointment to your parents. The people who know you the best in the world. “Why can’t we be united like Biden said Waaa! Waaa!” “Oh your a republican who I have literally 0 other pieces of information about. Fuck yourself” My politics are go fuck yourself. I can roast Republicans way harder.</p>
